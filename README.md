NOTE : this application only runs on linux systems and uses the command "ifconfig" from the net-tools package.

NETWORK SCANNER is a simple bash script that prints out some local networks informations.
Once those informations displayed, the user can run a basic ICMP scan to see which devices are pingable on the connected network.
If pingable, those devices can then be port scanned, to see if there are any open ports (among the top 25 most scanned ports).

This application has been designed for educational and training purposes only, I am well aware that it is far from perfect.
